				<h1>Brief</h1>
				<p>For this project, I aim to create a drawing application that allows users to draw shapes, lines and
					manage colours. The overall purpose of this application is to help educate young children on the
					basics of geometry through various shapes, and encourage creativity in a childâ€™s mind; giving them
					the freedom to endlessly explore principles of composition and style. This should hopefully include
					the simple features of a drawing application like shape, size and colour tools, which may lead to a
					more advanced canvas where older children can continue to learn from new methods and ways of
					thinking about creativity. Through the development of creativity at a young age, this will help to
					advance mental growth in things such as problem-solving and new possibilities, while also helping
					to gain an understanding of how a child thinks or feels.

					<br>I intend to follow the agile process throughout the production of this project, as I believe
					this method is best suited to achieve my ideal outcome successfully. I will also be using GitHub,
					which is a website that can manage and store my entire project accordingly, including the project
					backlog and projects for each sprint (which are important aspects of the agile process). GitHub can
					also record and track each stage of working throughout the build, allowing access to previous
					versions of my final project in case unpredicted situations were to occur.

    <h2 id="S1">Sprint One</h2>
<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint one is to create a basic canvas with a grid, that follows the movement and
acknowledges the boundaries of the mouse. On top of this, I aim to include a traceable guide that once released by
the mouse, a permanent box is drawn.</p>

<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the boundaries on the mouse through console logging the class
'InteractiveObject', which I have designed to tract the status of the mouse. It is shown in the video, that the
mouse's movements (click, down and up) will only be recorded if the mouse is inside the canvas, this is because in
the future of this project, the user should not be needing to draw or control elements outside canvas as that is the
primary use for a canvas. It can also be seen that my grid class is successfully working in the background
of the canvas and the canvas itself has been created without fault. So far, in these early stages I have been
presented with no unexpected errors.</p>

<p>In this video test, I am testing the functionality of the draggable guide and the drawing of rectangles. As
shown in the beginning of the video, as long as the mouse stays within the canvas. The draggable guide correctly
follows the dragging of a users mouse to indicate to them where the box will be drawn and when released,
the box also correctly follows the position of the draggable guide when released. While these aspects of my
code do work accordingly, there are also some errors that occur. <br> Due to the fact that the mouse's actions are not
recorded while outside the canvas, if the user was to press and hold the mouse inside the canvas, to then
move the mouse outside the canvas without the mouse being released, a box cannot be drawn. So when the
mouse returns to the canvas up, the guide still follows the mouse but no box is drawn. A similar thing occurs
when the mouse has gone outside the canvas, to return down. Because the origin point where the mouse clicked
down was not recorded, upon releasing the mouse inside the canvas, the box is drawn in an incorrect place and
there is an absence of the draggable guide. Finally, due to the method I used to create the draggable guide,
the sizing of the inner circle sometimes ends up not sizing correctly in relation to the outer box, which
results in the circle to surpass the edges of the box.</p>

 <h2>Sprint Review</h2>
<p>In summary, this sprint has been fairly successful in terms of setting up the project for a large range of
possibilities. I can track the relevant movements and position of the users mouse which is important for many
aspects like drawing and selecting shapes and options. As of this sprint, the user can draw a coloured box
with the assistance of the draggable guide inside the gridded canvas. While there were a few errors that I
noticed to do with the user entering and exiting the mouse as well as with the draggable guide (which I
discussed in detail in the testing), I intend to fix these errors in future sprints so the program is
error-proof, which is something very important when dealing with the unexpected nature of children.</p>

				<h2 id="S2">Sprint Two</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint two is to create two buttons that will allow the user to draw
				either an ellipse shape with their mouse or a rectangle shape. I aim to have a working class
				and function that will correctly draw and show a draggable guide for the ellipse, as well as
				create a button class to manage these two possible options for drawing.</p>

						<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the functionality of sprint 2 and how
						both my ellipse, guide and buttons work. As it can be seen, moving from drawing
						rectangles to ellipses is manageable and works as intended for the user. It is a clear
						for the user what the purpose of each button is and now the user has slightly
						more variation in my drawing program. I had a small problem with the guide earlier on
						in the sprint (as seen in the image below), where the circle was not drawing in the
						correct position. Fortunately, this was only a very small mistake, as I quickly realised
						that I had forgotten to divide my x+w and y+h values by two, so the circle guide would
						correctly draw where the mouse was clicked. Aside from this, this sprint ran fairly
						smoothly as I was able to add the ellipse class and function, to be ran dependant on
						the status of the InteractiveButton class, which I created for the purpose of selectable
						buttons. I have also included a few lines of code that I have used for the boundaries
						for the button class. This was important to get right so the buttons work as desired. At
						the end of the video it is shown how the same issue with the rectangles and the user
						leaving the canvas also occurs when the user draws an ellipse. While I clearly have not
						fixed this error in this sprint, I still aim to improve this in future sprints so my
						program is error free and able to be used by a user seamlessly. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In the end, this sprint was completed as expected and there were no major errors that I faced
				while building it. I successfully created an ellipse function and class so the user can draw
				ellipses at this current stage. Pairing with this, the draggable guide for the ellipse also
				is working without any remaining errors. I am satisfied with how the InteractiveButton class
				functions as the boundaries and task that each button is set to do, is completed in the
				intended way. I think this base class should work well for the future of this project,
				especially as most sprints aims are to include a new feature to the drawing project, each
				that should have a different button to be able to use it. All the current issues are ones
				that I addressed in sprint 1, as the same thing occurs when drawing ellipses if the user
				enters and exits the canvas, which should be something I will fix in a future sprint.</p>

				<h2 id="S3">Sprint Three</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint three is to create a colour swatch that consists of the
				colours and ranging opacities for each one in my colour array (colArray). With this, the
				user should be able to select the colour of the shapes drawn from a clearly presented group
				of colours</p>

						<p>The image to the right, I am testing if the swatch's layout prints correctly. There
						are many ways that a swatch can be printed out and displayed for a user. I
						wanted to be sure whilst designing this feature, that it was not overwhelming to the
						user (minimalist) and that it was printed in a way that would be recognisable to
						the user as a colour swatch, without any written indication. To print the swatch,
						I created an array called swatch_set, so I could loop through the colour array
						that contains my colour palette, with the varying opacities on a new line.
						Using this method of printing my swatch out complies with the relevant implication
						of future proofing. This is because I can easily add more colours and/or opacities that
						will be looped through and added to the swatch. </p>

						<p>In the video to the right, I am testing if my main swatch function works how
						intended. This would be when a colour and opacity is selected, the object is drawn with
						the correct properties. My swatch class is very similar to my interactive object
						class. The few key differences is that a text variable is not required, and
						instead of the fill colour changing while hovering over or selecting the button,
						the outline colour is what changes. It was necessary to have the outline change
						colour because the colour is what the user is selecting. From here, I ran the
						swatch through the loop that I have already created. As you can see in the video,
						the colour and opacity will correctly change for both shapes when a particular
						button in the swatch is selected, meaning that the implementation of this
						component went smoothly. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, this sprint worked accordingly and no impactful errors occurred while I was
					building each component. While considering the aesthetics and recognisability of my
				swatch, I was able to print my intended design successfully with a loop through both
					arrays. On top of this, I was able to then create a swatch class successfully and
				make each unique colour and opacity into a button that the user is able to select
				and change the colours of shapes. I believe that this was an important step to
				follow through the principles of agile, as an essential aspect of a drawing function
				is the option to change the colour of items. I am satisfied with how this sprint
				went and no unexpected errors occurred.</p>

				<h2 id="S4">Sprint Four</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint four is to add two new shape options to widen the
				drawing possibilities for users with a triangle and line option. As well as this, I
				also want to implement a clear canvas, undo and redo option for shapes that have
				been drawn. </p>

						<p>As can be seen in the first testing image to the left, I was successfully
						able to create a triangle class and function. This class and function did
						correctly make a triangle, although I found it difficult to work out the
						correct point values for an isosceles triangle. The triangle in the image
						is one of my many attempts to assign the correct values for the object. <br>
						As well as this, I also wanted to create a line tool, where the user can
						draw a line that spans from the mouse down point to the release point.
						This was not difficult to create a new button for, and due to the agile
						process, I will embellish this option in future sprints. As seen in the video
						to the left, I managed to successfully work out what the correct variables
						were to print the triangle as intended, and the line is also working
						accordingly. Both new objects can also have their colour and/or opacity
						adjusted, with option bar that can be easily switched between. </p>

						<p>For the second component that was implemented in this sprint, I added in
						a clear canvas option. To do this, when the button is clicked, the
						object array is set back to zero. When this occurs, all items that have been drawn on the
						canvas will be removed so the user can now create new drawings and/or
						clear a cluttered canvas. When adding this feature, there was no unexpected

						<p>To create an undo option, I popped the last object that was drawn in
						the object array. As you can see in the first video to the left in this
						component, the undo button worked fairly well, as only one object would
						be removed once the undo button was properly clicked on. An unintended
						error occurred that I was quickly reminded of when building this button,
						of which there are no boundaries on the clickable buttons located within
						the canvas boundary. Due to this, as can be seen in the console log, when
						the undo button is selected to undo, a new object will be formed to
						remove from the object array. This is why the undo button needed to be
						clicked twice before a noticeable object was removed from the canvas. To
						fix this error, I set a new variable to the width and height of the canvas
						without the buttons, so a new shape can only be drawn within those set
						values to resolve this error. Due to the fact that I am following the
						agile process, I implemented the easiest way to boundary check, which
						will be later improved so manual measurements do not need to be assigned
						particular values. <br>As shown in the video below this one in the
						component test, upon fixing up this error, the undo function now
						functions in the way that I had intended it to be.</p>

						<p>When building this final component for the sprint, I used a similar
						method to the undo component. Through creating a removedSet array, I
						slightly altered the undo component as instead of only popping the last
						object drawn from my objectSet array, I then pushed the item into the new
						array called removedSet. From here, I reversed this action when the user
						intends to redo this aspect, by instead popping the last drawn item in the
						array and pushing it to my object array. This component mainly worked the
						intended way, although I noticed that an unexpected error would occur when
						there was nothing in the object or removed array. To fix this error, which
						has been shown to be fixed in the final video of this sprint, I included an
						if statement, so that items will only be popped from the arrays if they are
						greater than zero in length.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, this sprint worked mostly as intended and all expected components were
				eventually successfully incorporated into my main program. In this sprint, after
				finding the correct values for the triangle points, I added two new shape options
				for the user in this drawing program to give them a wider variety of accessible tools.
				I am satisfied with how the isosceles triangle is drawn upon the release of the users
				mouse and will embellish the line option later on in the production process. For the
				second component that was added in this sprint, the clear canvas option was built
				smoothly without any intended errors and ran in the correct way. Upon creating the
				undo and redo components, I noticed that some form of boundaries will also need to be
				implemented in this sprint, so components will work the intended way. It is clear that
				this method used (as discussed above) will need to be addressed and altered in future
				sprints, due to the fact that it does not follow the future proofing relevant
				implication. Once this aspect was included, I was satisfied with the way that the
				undo and redo options behaved with varying possible inputs that a user could make,
				which I tested above. I believe that this sprint was successful in the regard where
				almost all errors that occurred where properly addressed, and many aspects were
				still able to be cleanly build without errors.</p>
