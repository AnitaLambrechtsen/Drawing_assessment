				<h1>Brief</h1>
				<p>For this project, I aim to create a drawing application that allows users to draw shapes, lines and
					manage colours. The overall purpose of this application is to help educate young children on the
					basics of geometry through various shapes, and encourage creativity in a childâ€™s mind; giving them
					the freedom to endlessly explore principles of composition and style. This should hopefully include
					the simple features of a drawing application like shape, size and colour tools, which may lead to a
					more advanced canvas where older children can continue to learn from new methods and ways of
					thinking about creativity. Through the development of creativity at a young age, this will help to
					advance mental growth in things such as problem-solving and new possibilities, while also helping
					to gain an understanding of how a child thinks or feels.

					<br>I intend to follow the agile process throughout the production of this project, as I believe
					this method is best suited to achieve my ideal outcome successfully. I will also be using GitHub,
					which is a website that can manage and store my entire project accordingly, including the project
					backlog and projects for each sprint (which are important aspects of the agile process). GitHub can
					also record and track each stage of working throughout the build, allowing access to previous
					versions of my final project in case unpredicted situations were to occur.

    <h2 id="S1">Sprint One</h2>
<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint one is to create a basic canvas with a grid, that follows the movement and
acknowledges the boundaries of the mouse. On top of this, I aim to include a traceable guide that once released by
the mouse, a permanent box is drawn.</p>

					<div class="col">

<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the boundaries on the mouse through console logging the class
'InteractiveObject', which I have designed to tract the status of the mouse. It is shown in the video, that the
mouse's movements (click, down and up) will only be recorded if the mouse is inside the canvas, this is because in
the future of this project, the user should not be needing to draw or control elements outside canvas as that is the
primary use for a canvas. It can also be seen that my grid class is successfully working in the background
of the canvas and the canvas itself has been created without fault. So far, in these early stages I have been
presented with no unexpected errors.</p>

<p>In this video test, I am testing the functionality of the draggable guide and the drawing of rectangles. As
shown in the beginning of the video, as long as the mouse stays within the canvas. The draggable guide correctly
follows the dragging of a users mouse to indicate to them where the box will be drawn and when released,
the box also correctly follows the position of the draggable guide when released. While these aspects of my
code do work accordingly, there are also some errors that occur. <br> Due to the fact that the mouse's actions are not
recorded while outside the canvas, if the user was to press and hold the mouse inside the canvas, to then
move the mouse outside the canvas without the mouse being released, a box cannot be drawn. So when the
mouse returns to the canvas up, the guide still follows the mouse but no box is drawn. A similar thing occurs
when the mouse has gone outside the canvas, to return down. Because the origin point where the mouse clicked
down was not recorded, upon releasing the mouse inside the canvas, the box is drawn in an incorrect place and
there is an absence of the draggable guide. Finally, due to the method I used to create the draggable guide,
the sizing of the inner circle sometimes ends up not sizing correctly in relation to the outer box, which
results in the circle to surpass the edges of the box.</p>

 <h2>Sprint Review</h2>
<p>In summary, this sprint has been fairly successful in terms of setting up the project for a large range of
possibilities. I can track the relevant movements and position of the users mouse which is important for many
aspects like drawing and selecting shapes and options. As of this sprint, the user can draw a coloured box
with the assistance of the draggable guide inside the gridded canvas. While there were a few errors that I
noticed to do with the user entering and exiting the mouse as well as with the draggable guide (which I
discussed in detail in the testing), I intend to fix these errors in future sprints so the program is
error-proof, which is something very important when dealing with the unexpected nature of children.</p>
