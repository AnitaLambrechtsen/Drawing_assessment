				<h1>Brief</h1>
				<p>For this project, I aim to create a drawing application that allows users to draw shapes, lines and
					manage colours. The overall purpose of this application is to help educate young children on the
					basics of geometry through various shapes, and encourage creativity in a childâ€™s mind; giving them
					the freedom to endlessly explore principles of composition and style. This should hopefully include
					the simple features of a drawing application like shape, size and colour tools, which may lead to a
					more advanced canvas where older children can continue to learn from new methods and ways of
					thinking about creativity. Through the development of creativity at a young age, this will help to
					advance mental growth in things such as problem-solving and new possibilities, while also helping
					to gain an understanding of how a child thinks or feels.

					<br>I intend to follow the agile process throughout the production of this project, as I believe
					this method is best suited to achieve my ideal outcome successfully. I will also be using GitHub,
					which is a website that can manage and store my entire project accordingly, including the project
					backlog and projects for each sprint (which are important aspects of the agile process). GitHub can
					also record and track each stage of working throughout the build, allowing access to previous
					versions of my final project in case unpredicted situations were to occur.

    <h2 id="S1">Sprint One</h2>
<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint one is to create a basic canvas with a grid, that follows the movement and
acknowledges the boundaries of the mouse. On top of this, I aim to include a traceable guide that once released by
the mouse, a permanent box is drawn.</p>

<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the boundaries on the mouse through console logging the class
'InteractiveObject', which I have designed to tract the status of the mouse. It is shown in the video, that the
mouse's movements (click, down and up) will only be recorded if the mouse is inside the canvas, this is because in
the future of this project, the user should not be needing to draw or control elements outside canvas as that is the
primary use for a canvas. It can also be seen that my grid class is successfully working in the background
of the canvas and the canvas itself has been created without fault. So far, in these early stages I have been
presented with no unexpected errors.</p>

<p>In this video test, I am testing the functionality of the draggable guide and the drawing of rectangles. As
shown in the beginning of the video, as long as the mouse stays within the canvas. The draggable guide correctly
follows the dragging of a users mouse to indicate to them where the box will be drawn and when released,
the box also correctly follows the position of the draggable guide when released. While these aspects of my
code do work accordingly, there are also some errors that occur. <br> Due to the fact that the mouse's actions are not
recorded while outside the canvas, if the user was to press and hold the mouse inside the canvas, to then
move the mouse outside the canvas without the mouse being released, a box cannot be drawn. So when the
mouse returns to the canvas up, the guide still follows the mouse but no box is drawn. A similar thing occurs
when the mouse has gone outside the canvas, to return down. Because the origin point where the mouse clicked
down was not recorded, upon releasing the mouse inside the canvas, the box is drawn in an incorrect place and
there is an absence of the draggable guide. Finally, due to the method I used to create the draggable guide,
the sizing of the inner circle sometimes ends up not sizing correctly in relation to the outer box, which
results in the circle to surpass the edges of the box.</p>

 <h2>Sprint Review</h2>
<p>In summary, this sprint has been fairly successful in terms of setting up the project for a large range of
possibilities. I can track the relevant movements and position of the users mouse which is important for many
aspects like drawing and selecting shapes and options. As of this sprint, the user can draw a coloured box
with the assistance of the draggable guide inside the gridded canvas. While there were a few errors that I
noticed to do with the user entering and exiting the mouse as well as with the draggable guide (which I
discussed in detail in the testing), I intend to fix these errors in future sprints so the program is
error-proof, which is something very important when dealing with the unexpected nature of children.</p>

				<h2 id="S2">Sprint Two</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint two is to create two buttons that will allow the user to draw
				either an ellipse shape with their mouse or a rectangle shape. I aim to have a working class
				and function that will correctly draw and show a draggable guide for the ellipse, as well as
				create a button class to manage these two possible options for drawing.</p>

						<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the functionality of sprint 2 and how
						both my ellipse, guide and buttons work. As it can be seen, moving from drawing
						rectangles to ellipses is manageable and works as intended for the user. It is a clear
						for the user what the purpose of each button is and now the user has slightly
						more variation in my drawing program. I had a small problem with the guide earlier on
						in the sprint (as seen in the image below), where the circle was not drawing in the
						correct position. Fortunately, this was only a very small mistake, as I quickly realised
						that I had forgotten to divide my x+w and y+h values by two, so the circle guide would
						correctly draw where the mouse was clicked. Aside from this, this sprint ran fairly
						smoothly as I was able to add the ellipse class and function, to be ran dependant on
						the status of the InteractiveButton class, which I created for the purpose of selectable
						buttons. I have also included a few lines of code that I have used for the boundaries
						for the button class. This was important to get right so the buttons work as desired. At
						the end of the video it is shown how the same issue with the rectangles and the user
						leaving the canvas also occurs when the user draws an ellipse. While I clearly have not
						fixed this error in this sprint, I still aim to improve this in future sprints so my
						program is error free and able to be used by a user seamlessly. </p>
					</div>

				<hr>
				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In the end, this sprint was completed as expected and there were no major errors that I faced
				while building it. I successfully created an ellipse function and class so the user can draw
				ellipses at this current stage. Pairing with this, the draggable guide for the ellipse also
				is working without any remaining errors. I am satisfied with how the InteractiveButton class
				functions as the boundaries and task that each button is set to do, is completed in the
				intended way. I think this base class should work well for the future of this project,
				especially as most sprints aims are to include a new feature to the drawing project, each
				that should have a different button to be able to use it. All the current issues are ones
				that I addressed in sprint 1, as the same thing occurs when drawing ellipses if the user
				enters and exits the canvas, which should be something I will fix in a future sprint.</p>

				<h2 id="S3">Sprint Three</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint three is to create a colour swatch that consists of the
				colours and ranging opacities for each one in my colour array (colArray). With this, the
				user should be able to select the colour of the shapes drawn from a clearly presented group
				of colours</p>

						<p>The image to the right, I am testing if the swatch's layout prints correctly. There
						are many ways that a swatch can be printed out and displayed for a user. I
						wanted to be sure whilst designing this feature, that it was not overwhelming to the
						user (minimalist) and that it was printed in a way that would be recognisable to
						the user as a colour swatch, without any written indication. To print the swatch,
						I created an array called swatch_set, so I could loop through the colour array
						that contains my colour palette, with the varying opacities on a new line.
						Using this method of printing my swatch out complies with the relevant implication
						of future proofing. This is because I can easily add more colours and/or opacities that
						will be looped through and added to the swatch. </p>

						<p>In the video to the right, I am testing if my main swatch function works how
						intended. This would be when a colour and opacity is selected, the object is drawn with
						the correct properties. My swatch class is very similar to my interactive object
						class. The few key differences is that a text variable is not required, and
						instead of the fill colour changing while hovering over or selecting the button,
						the outline colour is what changes. It was necessary to have the outline change
						colour because the colour is what the user is selecting. From here, I ran the
						swatch through the loop that I have already created. As you can see in the video,
						the colour and opacity will correctly change for both shapes when a particular
						button in the swatch is selected, meaning that the implementation of this
						component went smoothly. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, this sprint worked accordingly and no impactful errors occurred while I was
					building each component. While considering the aesthetics and recognisability of my
				swatch, I was able to print my intended design successfully with a loop through both
					arrays. On top of this, I was able to then create a swatch class successfully and
				make each unique colour and opacity into a button that the user is able to select
				and change the colours of shapes. I believe that this was an important step to
				follow through the principles of agile, as an essential aspect of a drawing function
				is the option to change the colour of items. I am satisfied with how this sprint
				went and no unexpected errors occurred.</p>

				<h2 id="S4">Sprint Four</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint four is to add two new shape options to widen the

				also want to implement a clear canvas, undo and redo option for shapes that have
				been drawn. </p>

						<p>As can be seen in the first testing image to the left, I was successfully

						correctly make a triangle, although I found it difficult to work out the
						correct point values for an isosceles triangle. The triangle in the image
						is one of my many attempts to assign the correct values for the object. <br>
						As well as this, I also wanted to create a line tool, where the user can
						draw a line that spans from the mouse down point to the release point.
						This was not difficult to create a new button for, and due to the agile
						process, I will embellish this option in future sprints. As seen in the video
						to the left, I managed to successfully work out what the correct variables
						were to print the triangle as intended, and the line is also working
						accordingly. Both new objects can also have their colour and/or opacity

						<p>To create an undo option, I popped the last object that was drawn in
						the object array. As you can see in the first video to the left in this
						component, the undo button worked fairly well, as only one object would
						be removed once the undo button was properly clicked on. An unintended
						error occurred that I was quickly reminded of when building this button,
						of which there are no boundaries on the clickable buttons located within
						the canvas boundary. Due to this, as can be seen in the console log, when
						the undo button is selected to undo, a new object will be formed to
						remove from the object array when clicking an option in the toolbar. This is why the undo
						button needed to be clicked more than once before a noticeable object was removed from the
						canvas. To fix this error, I set a new variable to the width and height of the canvas
						without the buttons, so a new shape can only be drawn within those set
						values. Due to the fact that I am following the
						agile process, I implemented a simple boundary check, which
						will be later improved so manual measurements do not need to be assigned
						particular values. <br> As seen in the second video, upon adding the
						boundary feature, the user can no longer start a drawing in the toolbar
						area, and so if they click on a button, no
						object will be drawn. What I have also demonstrated in this video is that
						this does not apply when the user ends the shape in the toolbar, meaning that
						a shape may be drawn over buttons and covering them. This issue I intend
						to fix in future sprints, as currently the functionality of my program due
						to this and the other issue with boundaries I previously mentioned, is
						not at an acceptable standard. <br>As shown in the third video in the
						component test, upon fixing up this error, the undo function now
						functions in the way that I had intended it to be.</p>

						<p>When building this final component for the sprint, I used a similar
						method to the undo component. Through creating a removedSet array, I
						slightly altered the undo component as instead of only popping the last
						object drawn from my objectSet array, I then pushed the item into the new
						array called removedSet. From here, I reversed this action when the user
						intends to redo this aspect, by instead popping the last drawn item in the
						array and pushing it to my object array. This component mainly worked the
						intended way, although I noticed that an unexpected error would occur when
						there was nothing in the object or removed array. To fix this error, which
						has been shown to be fixed in the final video of this sprint, I included an
						if statement, so that items will only be popped from the arrays if they are
						greater than zero-in-length.</p>

				</div>
				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, this sprint worked mostly as intended and all expected components were
				eventually successfully incorporated into my main program. In this sprint, after
				finding the correct values for the triangle points, I added two new shape options
				for the user in this drawing program to give them a wider variety of accessible tools.
				I am satisfied with how the isosceles triangle is drawn upon the release of the users
				mouse and will embellish the line option later on in the production process. For the
				second component that was added in this sprint, the clear canvas option was built
				smoothly without any intended errors and ran in the correct way. Upon creating the
				undo and redo components, I noticed that some form of boundaries will also need to be
				implemented in this sprint, so components will work the intended way. It is clear that
				this method used (as discussed above) will need to be addressed and altered in future
				sprints, due to the fact that it does not follow the future proofing relevant
				implication. Once this aspect was included, I was satisfied with the way that the
				undo and redo options behaved with varying possible inputs that a user could make,
				which I tested above. I believe that this sprint was successful in the regard where
				almost all errors that occurred where properly addressed, and many aspects were
				still able to be cleanly build without errors.</p>

				<h2 id="S5">Sprint Five</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint five is to add a feature to my shape tools that is
				very common in drawing tools such as Google Drawing and Adobe Illustrator. I
				aim to give the users the ability to hold down their shift key, that will turn
				a rectangle into a square or an ellipse into a circle, if either button is selected
				and the shift key is held when the mouse is released. </p>

						<p>In this first component test, I am testing whether my circle class functions
						in the intended way. As seen in the video, I have not altered the draggable
						guide to match the circle, as all I have done in this first component
						is ensure that the circle is being drawn correctly, in relation to the users
						mouse when selected. The implementation of this component went smoothly,
						without any unexpected errors. <br> Another noticeable addition that I made in
						this sprint is to do with styling and aesthetics. I slightly changed the font
						to still be readable, though less bold, so I have room to add more features in
						the near future. As well as this, by making the clear button red, users will
						recognise this as a sign of a warning due to things like stop signs and traffic
						lights. This is important because it will clear the whole canvas, so they
						are warned to consider clicking the button beforehand. Its position in the
						top left corner also is to subtly aid the users, improving the usability of
						my program, as users should also be familiar with the idea of a clear or exit
						button located in either the top left or right corner of a screen or object. Using this
						similar logic, an undo button with a pink/light red tone also indicates that it will do a
						similar action to a clear canvas button, as instead of clearing all objects,
						only one object is removed.	The green redo button, which is a colour of nature
						and renewal, also makes aesthetic sense to colour it this colour, so users have
						a subconscious idea that nothing will be removed when selecting this button.

						although the circle guide is not sizing correctly. To create the rectangle
						guide, I updated the height and width variables to be the same, depending
						on what the smaller value is. I believe that this is a good design and
						should work when it comes to actually drawing the shape. The ellipse on the

						will extend the square when the mouse crosses over the diagonal line that
						can be seen in the guide. <br> To fix this error, as seen in the video

						<p>As seen in the first video test of drawing a circle while the shift key is held component,
						when I attempted to draw the circle while the shift key is held and the ellipse button is
						selected, a circle is drawn in the correct position if the mouse and shift key is released at
						the same time. Unfortunately, the circle was also being drawn if the shift key is hit without
						the mouse being down while the ellipse button is selected. This means that
						there is an error in the section of my program related to how the shape is
						being drawn and possibly the variables that are being used to draw the circle.
						Fortunately, the drawing of the ellipse has not been altered if no additional
						keys are pressed with the ellipse button selected. I also commented out the draggable
						guide component, as I believed that it would be easier to ensure that the two
						components work co-dependently before combining the two of them. Due to this aspect,
						I also noticed that there were two possible ways that I could have the
						circle drawn while the shift key is held. The first possibility would be where
						the original draggable guide was in the previous component, starting at the where
						the mouse was first down. This would then have the diameter of either the width or
						height (depending on what was smaller). If I was to continue with this option, the
						box that the circle is drawn it will be disconnected from the mouse. This is because you
						cannot force the mouse to go in certain positions like where the perfect
						circle would end in javascript, as the user must be able to control their mouse
						due to the malicious possibilities of designers, such as forcing a mouse to click a
						link that will download malware onto the user's device. The second design
						option is to keep a base rectangle for the draggable guide, and the ellipse in
						the centre will change from an ellipse to a circle depending on whether the
						shift key is still held. <br> As seen in the next video, I decided to go with the
						second design for drawing a circle while the shift key is held. This is because
						I believe the design is cleaner and easier for users to understand. This means
						that the mouse will be constantly still attached to a guide and the ellipse
						or circle will be drawn from the centre point of when the mouse is first down,
						to when the mouse is released up. To fix the error that occurred in my last test,
						I altered the variables that I was using when drawing the circle and with a set
						design option, it was easier to result in the outcome I intended, so the
						circle is drawn correctly. In the final video, I combined both the correct
						way the circle is being drawn and the altered draggable guide to fit the
						second design. I am satisfied with how the ellipse cleanly shifts from an
						ellipse to a circle from within the rectangle when the shift key is held
						and I believe this is easily understood by users. </p>

						<p>When implementing the shift key option to the rectangle shape component,
						the first video highlights the errors that I were faced with. If I was to
						use the first design method, this would once again separate the mouse from
						the guide, and so I updated this method as well, to match the second
						design. On top of this, I noticed that the square was not able to be drawn
						in the top right or bottom left. In the second video, I resolved this
						error through using abs, as the values would become negative and unable
						to be drawn as the rectangle was being drawn based on whether the width
						or height was larger, so in particular directions this would incorrectly
						change. The draggable guide follows a similar design to the ellipse, which can be seen in
						the second video, where the transition from a rectangle to a square is
						also clean and ended up being following the design that I had intended.
						Mostly, in the implementation of this component, I followed a similar
						method to the ellipse button, with if else statements for whether the shift
						key is held or not. </p>

						is working accordingly, as there were many components to this sprint. One
						noticeable feature that I altered at the very end was to take out the
						circle button. I did this because now the users can create circles through the

						<p>At the end of this sprint, I thought it would be fitting to do a usability
						test. The relevant implication of usability is an important thing to
						consider, especially when designing a program for the intended audience
						of children, so everything must be relatively comprehensible. As the
						main purpose of this program is to be a drawing program, if it is
						difficult to produce drawings, then the usability of the program is failing.
						Later in the development of my program, I will also do a test on another
						person to test for unexpected behaviour. From a personal test, I found
						my program to be easy to use and draw with. I was grateful for undo and redo
						buttons as there were a few mistakes made along the way, which is a benefit
						in the regard of functionality. Overall, I am satisfied with the progress
						that I have currently made, although there are still further features
						that I hope to achieve to enhance and develop drawing possibilities.</p>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>This sprint did have some unintended errors, although I am satisfied with the
				final outcome. In this sprint, I introduced circles and squares that can be drawn
				when the ellipse or rectangle button is selected and the user holds down the shift
				key while drawing. I did this through creating a new event listener which was
				successfully incorporated into my InteractiveObject class. When presented with some
				errors, I realised that there were two main designs that I could pick between
				when coding how the ellipse and rectangle moves into a circle or square when the
				shift key is held. I am satisfied with the design that I chose to follow through with,
				even though there were some unexpected errors which occurred while building the
				design. Some of these errors include incorrect placements of drawn objects in
				relation to the mouse and glitching draggable guides. Thankfully, I was able to
				internalise any additional errors that occurred in the process of building this
				sprint. As well as this, I made a few minor changes in terms of the aesthetics
				such as colour and placement. At the end of this sprint, I decided that it was also
				a good idea to do a usability test to see if my program is on track to matching
				the original brief. </p>

				<h2 id="S6">Sprint Six</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint six is to improve the boundaries of the canvas which is an error that
					I have previously mentioned earlier on in the project. This occurs when the user is drawing
					and the mouse leaves the canvas, or is down while entering the canvas. The
					user should also not be able to draw over the options, but still be able to
				draw them, as the options are located on the canvas.</p>

						<p>In this first component test, I figured that the way to solve the error
							occurring when the mouse leaves the canvas is through adding an if condition.
							While the mouse has left the canvas, if the mouse is down, then the mouse
							should be considered as up, and the boolean 'inBounds' and 'mouseIsDown' is false.
							This fixed the error that has been occurring because an object is drawn
							once a mouse that has been down is released, so as soon as the mouse
							leaves canvas the object will be automatically drawn at the edge as it is set
							to be up. This also means that when the mouse is entering the canvas held down, it
							will not be considered down, so an object will not be drawn upon release.

						<p>For this second component, my aim is to ensure that the user cannot draw an
						object over the toolbar. This is because it is crucial for the user to still be able to
						interpret the toolbar with all the buttons, for the purpose of usability, which
						would not be possible with a shape covering them. I did this using a JavaScript
						method which is to create a separate area from the main canvas that will be clipped.
						As the mUp() is still considered when the user's mouse leaves the canvas, the
						shape will be drawn at the edge of the canvas, although it will be drawn
						underneath the toolbar. As the toolbar is still located on the canvas, I enjoy
						this feature in my program instead os setting the mUp() to be within the clipped
						area. This also leaves the possibility for further options in the future of my
						program. These could be for the toolbar to be moved or minimised within the
						canvas that over the canvas and the objects drawn within it. In this first
						video test, everything is working seemingly as intended, although the toolbar
						alterations when hovered over or selected are not running. As I shortly noticed,
						this was because I had not included ctx.restore() at the end of my update class, which
							meant that these features of the toolbar were being clipped in that particular area.
						As seen in the following video, by including this line of code, my program
						was functioning as intended and these boundary errors have been resolved. </p>

						<p>Upon further trialling this sprint, I noticed a very small but important error
						that has a large impact on the functionality of my program. This was improved
						by one line of code, but as demonstrated in the first video, I had previously
						forgotten to set the InteractiveButton.selected to "" once the undo or
						redo array has been popped. This meant that it remained selected after this
						action has occurred, so wherever you select on the screen if either is selected,
						that action will continue to occur. This was quickly resolved, as
						seen in the second video, but demonstrates the importance of extensive testing. </p>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, this sprint was implemented fairly successfully and the components
				that were introduced into this sprint were eventually running as intended. While
				this sprint was relatively short in comparison to previous sprints, it was one
				that was crucial for the functionality and way that my program behaves. Ideally,
				a user would not need to leave the canvas, but in order for a program to
				be functional, it must be able to handle all forms of use, and improving this
				was the main aim for the sprint which I believe was achieved. While there was a
				minor error that occurred when clipping my toolbar from the whole canvas, this
				was shortly resolved. Choosing to allow the user to still draw in the area within
				the toolbar, only underneath, was the option that I chose to continue with
				and am satisfied with. This sprint also ensured that other issues cannot occur
				with leaving and entering the boundaries of the canvas, which is an important
				aspect of my program through considering a mouse that is down outside
				the canvas to be up and out of bounds.</p>

<h2> Relevant Implications Summary</h2>
				<h3><u>Sustainability and future proofing</u></h3>
				<p>Throughout my program, I have addressed the relevant implication of sustainability and
					future proofing. This relevant implication is important to consider, as a program
					should be adaptable and have the ability to expand with new applications and frequent updates.</p>
				<h3>Usability</h3>
				<p>The relevant implication, usability, is also very important to focus on while
					building a program. It focuses on the idea that a digital product is able to be
					understood and properly used for it's desired purpose. That errors can be recognised
					and recovered from throughout the process, that all information is displayed in
					a clear way, so the proper requirements of the program is executed in the most efficient way.</p>
				<h3>Functionality</h3>
				<p>The final relevant implication that I have addressed is functionality. Functionality
					is about having a digital product that operates correctly, without any errors or
					crashes. This is also a very important relevant implication to consider while
					building a program, as if there are many errors and crashes throughout a program,
					then the desired outcome cannot be reached. A functional program should perform
					with the expectation of errors and unexpected inputs/outcomes, and have the
					ability to either prevent or recover from these occurring. Especially when
					focusing around the input of a user, as mine does, because users cannot be relied
					upon to not make faults. If a system crashes or does not run with ease, then
					it's functionality is poor.</p>
