				<h1>Brief</h1>
				<p>For this project, I aim to create a drawing application that allows users to draw shapes, lines and
					manage colours. The overall purpose of this application is to help educate young children on the
					basics of geometry through various shapes, and encourage creativity in a childâ€™s mind; giving them
					the freedom to endlessly explore principles of composition and style. This should hopefully include
					the simple features of a drawing application like shape, size and colour tools, which may lead to a
					more advanced canvas where older children can continue to learn from new methods and ways of
					thinking about creativity. Through the development of creativity at a young age, this will help to
					advance mental growth in things such as problem-solving and new possibilities, while also helping
					to gain an understanding of how a child thinks or feels.

					<br>I intend to follow the agile process throughout the production of this project, as I believe
					this method is best suited to achieve my ideal outcome successfully. I will also be using GitHub,
					which is a website that can manage and store my entire project accordingly, including the project
					backlog and projects for each sprint (which are important aspects of the agile process). GitHub can
					also record and track each stage of working throughout the build, allowing access to previous
					versions of my final project in case unpredicted situations were to occur.

<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint one is to create a basic canvas with a grid, that follows the movement and
acknowledges the boundaries of the mouse. On top of this, I aim to include a traceable guide that once released by
the mouse, a permanent box is drawn.</p>

<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the boundaries on the mouse through console logging the class
'InteractiveObject', which I have designed to tract the status of the mouse. It is shown in the video, that the
mouse's movements (click down and back up) will only be recorded if the mouse is inside the canvas, this is because in
the future of this project, the user should not be needing to draw or control elements outside canvas as that is the
primary use for a canvas. It can also be seen that my grid class is successfully working in the background
of the canvas and the canvas itself has been created without fault. So far, in these early stages I have been
presented with no unexpected errors.</p>

<p>In this video test, I am testing the functionality of the draggable guide and the drawing of rectangles. As
shown in the beginning of the video, as long as the mouse stays within the canvas. The draggable guide correctly follows
the dragging of a user's mouse to indicate to them where they first clicked the mouse the box will be drawn from and when
the mouse button is released, the box also correctly follows the position of the draggable guide when released.  While
these aspects of my code do work accordingly, there are also some errors that occur. <br> Due to the fact that the mouse's
actions are not recorded while outside the canvas, if the user was to press and hold the mouse inside the canvas, to then
move the mouse outside the canvas without the mouse being released, a box cannot be drawn. So when the
mouse returns to the canvas up, the guide still follows the mouse but no box is drawn. A similar thing occurs
when the mouse has gone outside the canvas, to return down. Because the origin point where the mouse clicked
down was not recorded, upon releasing the mouse inside the canvas, the box is drawn in an incorrect place and
there is an absence of the draggable guide. Finally, due to the method I used to create the draggable guide,
the sizing of the inner circle sometimes ends up not sizing correctly in relation to the outer box, which
results in the circle to surpass the edges of the box.</p>

 <h2>Sprint Review</h2>
<p>In summary, this sprint has been fairly successful in terms of setting up the project for a large range of
possibilities. I can track the relevant movements and position of the users mouse which is important for many
aspects like drawing and selecting shapes and options. As of this sprint, the user can draw a coloured box
with the assistance of the draggable guide inside the gridded canvas. While there were a few errors that I
noticed to do with the user entering and exiting the mouse as well as with the draggable guide (which I
discussed in detail in the testing), I intend to fix these errors in future sprints so the program is
error-proof, which is something very important when dealing with the unexpected nature of children.</p>

				<h2 id="S2">Sprint Two</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint two is to create two buttons that will allow the user to draw
				either an ellipse shape with their mouse or a rectangle shape. I aim to have a working class
				and function that will correctly draw and show a draggable guide for the ellipse, as well as
				create a button class to manage these two possible options for drawing.</p>

						<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the functionality of sprint 2 and how
						both my ellipse, guide and buttons work. As it can be seen, moving from drawing
						rectangles to ellipses is manageable and works as intended for the user. It is a clear
						for the user what the purpose of each button is and now the user has slightly
						more variation in my drawing program. I had a small problem with the guide earlier on
						in the sprint (as seen in the image below), where the circle was not drawing in the
						correct position. Fortunately, this was only a very small mistake, as I quickly realised
						that I had forgotten to divide my x+w and y+h values by two, so the circle guide would
						correctly draw where the mouse was clicked. Aside from this, this sprint ran fairly
						smoothly as I was able to add the ellipse class and function, to be ran dependant on
						the status of the InteractiveButton class, which I created for the purpose of selectable
						buttons. I have also included a few lines of code that I have used for the boundaries
						for the button class. This was important to get right so the buttons work as desired. At
						the end of the video it is shown how the same issue with the rectangles and the user
						leaving the canvas also occurs when the user draws an ellipse. While I clearly have not
						fixed this error in this sprint, I still aim to improve this in future sprints so my
						program is error free and able to be used by a user seamlessly. </p>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In the end, this sprint was completed as expected and there were no major errors that I faced
				while building it. I successfully created an ellipse function and class so the user can draw
				ellipses at this current stage. Pairing with this, the draggable guide for the ellipse also
				is working without any remaining errors. I am satisfied with how the InteractiveButton class
				functions as the boundaries and task that each button is set to do, is completed in the
				intended way. I think this base class should work well for the future of this project,
				especially as most sprints aims are to include a new feature to the drawing project, each
				that should have a different button to be able to use it. All the current issues are ones
				that I addressed in sprint 1, as the same thing occurs when drawing ellipses if the user
				enters and exits the canvas, which should be something I will fix in a future sprint.</p>

				<h2 id="S3">Sprint Three</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint three is to create a colour swatch that consists of the
				colours and ranging opacities for each one in my colour array (colArray). With this, the
				user should be able to select the colour of the shapes drawn from a clearly presented group
				of colours</p>

						wanted to be sure whilst designing this feature, that it was not overwhelming to the
						user (minimalist) and that it was printed in a way that would be recognisable to
						the user as a colour swatch, without any written indication. To print the swatch,
						I created an array called swatch_set, so I could loop through the colour array
						that contains my colour palette, with the varying opacities on a new line.
						Using this method of printing my swatch out complies with the relevant implication
						of future proofing. This is because I can easily add more colours and/or opacities that
						will be looped through and added to the swatch. </p>

						<p>In the video to the right, I am testing if my main swatch function works how
						intended. This would be when a colour and opacity is selected, the object is drawn with
						the correct properties. My swatch class is very similar to my interactive object
						class. The few key differences is that a text variable is not required, and
						instead of the fill colour changing while hovering over or selecting the button,
						the outline colour is what changes. It was necessary to have the outline change
						colour because the colour is what the user is selecting. From here, I ran the
						swatch through the loop that I have already created. As you can see in the video,
						the colour and opacity will correctly change for both shapes when a particular
						button in the swatch is selected, meaning that the implementation of this
						component went smoothly. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, this sprint worked accordingly and no impactful errors occurred while I was
					building each component. While considering the aesthetics and recognisably of my
				swatch, I was able to print my intended design successfully with a loop through both
					arrays. On top of this, I was able to then create a swatch class successfully and
				make each unique colour and opacity into a button that the user is able to select
				and change the colours of shapes. I believe that this was an important step to
				follow through the principles of agile, as an essential aspect of a drawing function
				is the option to change the colour of items. I am satisfied with how this sprint
				went and no unexpected errors occurred.</p>

				<h2 id="S4">Sprint Four</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint four is to add two new shape options to widen the
				drawing possibilities for users with a triangle and line option. As well as this, I
				also want to implement a clear canvas, undo and redo option for shapes that have
				been drawn. </p>

						<p>As can be seen in the first testing image to the left, I was successfully
						able to create a triangle class and function by starting with beginPath(),

							certain point. This class and function did
						correctly make a triangle, although I found it difficult to work out the
						correct point values for an isosceles triangle. The triangle in the image
						is one of my many attempts to assign the correct values for the object. <br>
						As well as this, I also wanted to create a line tool, where the user can
						draw a line that spans from the mouse down point to the release point.
						This was not difficult to create a new button for, and due to the agile
						process, I will embellish this option in future sprints. As seen in the video
						to the left, I managed to successfully work out what the correct variables
						were to print the triangle as intended, and the line is also working
						accordingly. Both new objects can also have their colour and/or opacity

						a clear canvas option. To do this, when the button is clicked, the
						object array is set back to zero. When this occurs, all items that have been drawn on the
						canvas will be removed so the user can now create new drawings and/or
						clear a cluttered canvas. When adding this feature, there was no unexpected

						<p>To create an undo option, I popped the last object that was drawn in
						the object array. As you can see in the first video to the left in this
						component, the undo button worked fairly well, as only one object would
						be removed once the undo button was properly clicked on. An unintended
						error occurred that I was quickly reminded of when building this button,
						of which there are no boundaries on the clickable buttons located within
						the canvas boundary. Due to this, as can be seen in the console log, when
						the undo button is selected to undo, a new object will be formed to
						remove from the object array when clicking an option in the toolbar. This is why the undo
						button needed to be clicked more than once before a noticeable object was removed from the
						canvas. To fix this error, I set a new variable to the width and height of the canvas
						without the buttons, so a new shape can only be drawn within those set
						values. Due to the fact that I am following the
						agile process, I implemented a simple boundary check, which
						will be later improved so manual measurements do not need to be assigned
						particular values. <br>
							As seen in the second video, upon adding the
						boundary feature, the user can no longer start a drawing in the toolbar
						area. So if the user clicks on a button such as the undo button, no
						object will be drawn and the undo button would not need to be clicked multiple
							times to be functional. What I have also demonstrated in this video is that
						this does not apply when the user ends the shape in the toolbar, meaning that
						a shape may be drawn over buttons and covering them. This issue I intend
						to fix in future sprints, as currently the functionality of my program due
						to this and the other issue with boundaries I previously mentioned, is
						not at an acceptable standard. <br>As shown in the third video in the
						component test, upon fixing up this error, the undo function now
						functions in the way that I had intended it to be.</p>

						<p>When building this final component for the sprint, I used a similar
						method to the undo component. Through creating a removedSet array, I
						slightly altered the undo component as instead of only popping the last
						object drawn from my objectSet array, I then pushed the item into the new
						array called removedSet. From here, I reversed this action when the user
						intends to redo this aspect, by instead popping the last drawn item in the
						array and pushing it to my object array. This component mainly worked the
						intended way, although I noticed that an unexpected error would occur when
						there was nothing in the object or removed array. To fix this error, which
						has been shown to be fixed in the final video of this sprint, I included an
						if statement, so that items will only be popped from the arrays if they are
						greater than zero-in-length.</p>

				</div>
				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, this sprint worked mostly as intended and all expected components were
				eventually successfully incorporated into my main program. In this sprint, after
				finding the correct values for the triangle points, I added two new shape options
				for the user in this drawing program to give them a wider variety of accessible tools.
				I am satisfied with how the isosceles triangle is drawn upon the release of the users
				mouse and will embellish the line option later on in the production process. For the
				second component that was added in this sprint, the clear canvas option was built
				smoothly without any intended errors and ran in the correct way. Upon creating the
				undo and redo components, I noticed that some form of boundaries will also need to be
				implemented in this sprint, so components will work the intended way. It is clear that
				this method used (as discussed above) will need to be addressed and altered in future
				sprints, due to the fact that it does not follow the future proofing relevant
				implication. Once this aspect was included, I was satisfied with the way that the
				undo and redo options behaved with varying possible inputs that a user could make,
				which I tested above. I believe that this sprint was successful in the regard where
				almost all errors that occurred where properly addressed, and many aspects were
				still able to be cleanly build without errors.</p>

				<h2 id="S5">Sprint Five</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint five is to add a feature to my shape tools that is
				very common in drawing tools such as Google Drawing and Adobe Illustrator. I
				aim to give the users the ability to hold down their shift key, that will turn
				a rectangle into a square or an ellipse into a circle, if either button is selected
				and the shift key is held when the mouse is released. </p>

						<p>In this first component test, I am testing whether my circle class functions
						in the intended way. As seen in the video, I have not altered the draggable
						guide to match the circle, as all I have done in this first component
						is ensure that the circle is being drawn correctly, in relation to the users
						mouse when selected. The implementation of this component went smoothly,
						without any unexpected errors. <br> Another noticeable addition that I made in
						this sprint is to do with styling and aesthetics. I slightly changed the font
						to still be readable, though less bold, so I have room to add more features in
						the near future. As well as this, by making the clear button red, users will
						recognise this as a sign of a warning due to things like stop signs and traffic
						lights. This is important because it will clear the whole canvas, so they
						are warned to consider clicking the button beforehand. Its position in the
						top left corner also is to subtly aid the users, improving the usability of
						my program, as users should also be familiar with the idea of a clear or exit
						button located in either the top left or right corner of a screen or object. Using this
						similar logic, an undo button with a pink/light red tone also indicates that it will do a
						similar action to a clear canvas button, as instead of clearing all objects,
						only one object is removed.	The green redo button, which is a colour of nature
						and renewal, also makes aesthetic sense to colour it this colour, so users have
						a subconscious idea that nothing will be removed when selecting this button.

						should work when it comes to actually drawing the shape. The ellipse on the

						the same time. Unfortunately, the circle was also being drawn if the shift key is hit without
						the mouse being down while the ellipse button is selected. This means that
						there is an error in the section of my program related to how the shape is
						being drawn and possibly the variables that are being used to draw the circle.
						Fortunately, the drawing of the ellipse has not been altered if no additional
						keys are pressed with the ellipse button selected. I also commented out the draggable
						guide component, as I believed that it would be easier to ensure that the two
						components work co-dependently before combining the two of them. Due to this aspect,
						I also noticed that there were two possible ways that I could have the
						circle drawn while the shift key is held. The first possibility would be where
						the original draggable guide was in the previous component, starting at the where
						the mouse was first down. This would then have the diameter of either the width or
						height (depending on what was smaller). If I was to continue with this option, the
						box that the circle is drawn it will be disconnected from the mouse. This is because you
						cannot force the mouse to go in certain positions like where the perfect
						circle would end in javascript, as the user must be able to control their mouse
						due to the malicious possibilities of designers, such as forcing a mouse to click a
						link that will download malware onto the user's device. The second design
						option is to keep a base rectangle for the draggable guide, and the ellipse in
						the centre will change from an ellipse to a circle depending on whether the
						shift key is still held. <br> As seen in the next video, I decided to go with the
						second design for drawing a circle while the shift key is held. This is because
						I believe the design is cleaner and easier for users to understand. This means
						that the mouse will be constantly still attached to a guide and the ellipse
						or circle will be drawn from the centre point of when the mouse is first down,
						to when the mouse is released up. To fix the error that occurred in my last test,
						I altered the variables that I was using when drawing the circle and with a set
						design option, it was easier to result in the outcome I intended, so the
						circle is drawn correctly. In the final video, I combined both the correct
						way the circle is being drawn and the altered draggable guide to fit the
						second design. I am satisfied with how the ellipse cleanly shifts from an
						ellipse to a circle from within the rectangle when the shift key is held
						and I believe this is easily understood by users. </p>

						<p>When implementing the shift key option to the rectangle shape component,
						the first video highlights the errors that I were faced with. If I was to
						use the first design method, this would once again separate the mouse from
						the guide, and so I updated this method as well, to match the second
						design. On top of this, I noticed that the square was not able to be drawn
						in the top right or bottom left. In the second video, I resolved this
						error through using abs, as the values would become negative and unable
						to be drawn as the rectangle was being drawn based on whether the width
						or height was larger, so in particular directions this would incorrectly
						change. The draggable guide follows a similar design to the ellipse, which can be seen in
						the second video, where the transition from a rectangle to a square is
						also clean and ended up being following the design that I had intended.
						Mostly, in the implementation of this component, I followed a similar
						method to the ellipse button, with if else statements for whether the shift
						key is held or not. </p>

						noticeable feature that I altered at the very end was to take out the

						<p>At the end of this sprint, I thought it would be fitting to do a usability

						main purpose of this program is to be a drawing program, if it is
						difficult to produce drawings, then the usability of the program is failing.
						Later in the development of my program, I will also do a test on another

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>This sprint did have some unintended errors, although I am satisfied with the
				final outcome. In this sprint, I introduced circles and squares that can be drawn
				when the ellipse or rectangle button is selected and the user holds down the shift
				key while drawing. I did this through creating a new event listener which was
				successfully incorporated into my InteractiveObject class. When presented with some
				errors, I realised that there were two main designs that I could pick between
				when coding how the ellipse and rectangle moves into a circle or square when the
				shift key is held. I am satisfied with the design that I chose to follow through with,
				even though there were some unexpected errors which occurred while building the
				design. Some of these errors include incorrect placements of drawn objects in
				relation to the mouse and glitching draggable guides. Thankfully, I was able to
				internalise any additional errors that occurred in the process of building this
				sprint. As well as this, I made a few minor changes in terms of the aesthetics
				such as colour and placement. At the end of this sprint, I decided that it was also
				a good idea to do a usability test to see if my program is on track to matching
				the original brief. </p>

				<h2 id="S6">Sprint Six</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint six is to improve the boundaries of the canvas which is an error that
					I have previously mentioned earlier on in the project. This occurs when the user is drawing
					and the mouse leaves the canvas, or is down while entering the canvas. The
					user should also not be able to draw over the options, but still be able to
				draw them, as the options are located on the canvas.</p>

						<p>In this first component test, I figured that the way to solve the error

							While the mouse has left the canvas, if the mouse is down, then the mouse
							should be considered as up, and the boolean 'inBounds' and 'mouseIsDown' is false.
							This fixed the error that has been occurring because an object is drawn
							once a mouse that has been down is released, so as soon as the mouse
							leaves canvas the object will be automatically drawn at the edge as it is set
							to be up. This also means that when the mouse is entering the canvas held down, it

						<p>For this second component, my aim is to ensure that the user cannot draw an
						object over the toolbar. This is because it is crucial for the user to still be able to
						interpret the toolbar with all the buttons, for the purpose of usability, which
						would not be possible with a shape covering them. I did this using a JavaScript
						method which is to create a separate area from the main canvas that will be clipped.
						As the mUp() is still considered when the user's mouse leaves the canvas, the
						shape will be drawn at the edge of the canvas, although it will be drawn
						underneath the toolbar. As the toolbar is still located on the canvas, I enjoy
						this feature in my program instead os setting the mUp() to be within the clipped
						area. This also leaves the possibility for further options in the future of my
						program. These could be for the toolbar to be moved or minimised within the
						canvas that over the canvas and the objects drawn within it. In this first
						video test, everything is working seemingly as intended, although the toolbar
						alterations when hovered over or selected are not running. As I shortly noticed,
						this was because I had not included ctx.restore() at the end of my update class, which
							meant that these features of the toolbar were being clipped in that particular area.
						As seen in the following video, by including this line of code, my program
						was functioning as intended and these boundary errors have been resolved. </p>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, this sprint was implemented fairly successfully and the components
				that were introduced into this sprint were eventually running as intended. While
				this sprint was relatively short in comparison to previous sprints, it was one
				that was crucial for the functionality and way that my program behaves. Ideally,
				a user would not need to leave the canvas, but in order for a program to
				be functional, it must be able to handle all forms of use, and improving this
				was the main aim for the sprint which I believe was achieved. While there was a
				minor error that occurred when clipping my toolbar from the whole canvas, this
				was shortly resolved. Choosing to allow the user to still draw in the area within
				the toolbar, only underneath, was the option that I chose to continue with
				and am satisfied with. This sprint also ensured that other issues cannot occur
				with leaving and entering the boundaries of the canvas, which is an important
				aspect of my program through considering a mouse that is down outside
				the canvas to be up and out of bounds.</p>

				<h2 id="S7">Sprint 7</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint 7 is to improve the layout of the canvas more
				options can be available to the user in this program, and it is presented in a
				familiar but professional way. Within this, I aim to create a class with just
				a rectangle and text, so I can add instructions where they are needed. I also
				aim to create a new class with a main button, and then sub buttons, so within
				this sprint I can also develop the line and triangle object options. </p>

						<p>In this first component test, as seen in the image to the right, I
							edited the layout of my canvas. While this was tedious, it was
							successful and resulted in being a fairly identical image to the
							one that was intended in my expected diagram. To replicate this,
							I added six more colours into my colArray, to give the user more
							options for the colours of each shape, which spans as the majority
							of my top toolbar. Another adjustment I included to replicate the
							intended layout for my canvas, is adding in the buttons that will
							ideally be options for the user in the near future. While these
							buttons do not have a purpose yet, they will most likely be the
							focus of the next sprints. Finally, the last thing I added as a part
							of this component is a new rectangle with text class. This was
							fairly simple, but I created a class that is not a button, but
							can print text over a rectangle drawn. The intention of this class
							is for information and instructions to the user. This may be needed
							in the future more than currently, though the current reason I
							created this class is for informing the user about the shift
							option for rectangles and ellipses, as this does not need to be a
							separate interactive button. On top of this, through altering
						the layout of the toolbars, I also altered the boundaries and
						size of the canvas to ensure the boundaries were correct according
						to the new toolbar and that the users will still have enough space
						to draw on the canvas.</p>

						<p>For the second component test in this sprint, I was testing my SecondaryButton

						there were a few possible options for how I could design feature, such as
						creating arrays with the child buttons within the parent button, I decided
						that the method I chose was the most efficient for the purpose of
						sustainability and future proofing. Through using a similar process
						as my InteractiveButton and Swatch class, the class runs almost identically,
						if the parent button selected equals the parent button that the SecondaryButton
						falls under. As I still wanted the button to print regardless of whether the
						parent button was selected or not. As seen in the image to the left, when
						testing this on the small option under the line parent, through a few trials,
						most commonly the outcome would result in the button not being printed. This was
						often due to my check to see if the parent that was selected is
						the same as the one that is unique to that SecondaryButton resulting in the
							class to be unable to function. Fortunately,
						this was shortly solved with slight variations in my code. As of this

						<p>As seen in the first video of this component test, the aim for this

						matching the text with SecondaryButton.selected.text. In this second video,
						it is demonstrated how an Uncaught TypeError occurs with this scenario of
						code, as when the parent class is first selected, a child button selected
						does not yet exist (null) because the user has not yet selected a child
						button. From this, this error occurs, which is not an ideal design because
						the functionality of my program would be not matched to the expected standard.
						Aside from the error, the small, medium and large thickness options are working
						as intended. Due to the error, I created an if, else if statement to check if there is a

						<p>For my fifth component, I decided that it would be easiest to have a default

							of the program will improve for the user, as the buttons become less
							complicated and more efficient to use. To do this, I included a boolean
						called 'defaultButton', which is set to true if it is the default button
						and false if it is not. From this, by checking if there is a default button
						and there is no secondary button selected yet, the default button will automatically
						become selected. As seen in the first and second videos to the left, there
						were two errors that occurred when I first attempted to implicate this
						component. The shown in the first video, demonstrates how including
						a default button is mostly functional. The error occurs when the user was to
						select the parent button originally selected after using the undo or redo
						buttons. This occurs because when the SecondaryButton is set to null after
						the undo or redo button is selected, the SecondaryButton will remain selected
						because of my if statement, 'if (SecondaryButton.selected === this ||
							(this.defaultButton && SecondaryButton.selected === null )) {'. The
						second error, as shown in the second video, occurs when the user clicks on
						a child button from a different parent. This means that the original
						button is unselected which is not intended. To fix both of these errors,
						I included the if statement, 'if ( InteractiveButton.selected &&
							InteractiveButton.selected.text === this.parentButton ) {', to wrap
						where the buttons change when the buttons can become selected. By
						wrapping where the boundary can be retrieved in if statement, the second
						error is fixed because it can now only be retrieved if the parent
						button is selected. This also means the first error is resolved because
						the default button will be selected when the parent button is first
						selected. These fixes are shown in the last video, where it is
						demonstrated how all the components I have implemented in this
						sprint have been added as intended. </p>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In this sprint, there were a few unexpected errors, but overall, I am satisfied
				with the final outcome. In this sprint, I originally altered the layout of my
				canvas to allow for more shape options and colours that the user would have
				access to. This in turn meant that I had to alter the boundaries and then create
				a WordRect class. My next component was to design a SecondaryClass for the child
				buttons that would only be able to be selected if the parent button was. This
				had some unintended errors and once I had resolved these for this sprint, it became
					apparent in my following sprint when actually running different object
					options that the errors were not fully resolved. The next component That I implemented in this
				sprint was further line thickness options falling under the parent line button. Originally,
				null type errors occurred due to InteractiveButton.selected.text being null, that
				was fixed by first checking to see if the object existed. From this stage, I was able
				to both add the variations in the line tool and triangle tool. The last component in
				this sprint that I added was a default button for these shape options, to further prevent
				errors and improve the usability of my program. There were two errors that came with my
				first attempt at this component where a child button would not be selected as intended,
				that was resolved with another if statement. </p>

						<p>As seen in the image above and the two images to the left, there were two

						and then the second circle cuts the first circle in the area where they overlap.
						As I have also demonstrated, a design element that I have to consider is
						if the second circle should be the same or a smaller size than the original circle to create
						a different looking crescent. As also seen, the second approach is to draw two
						separate arcs to connect together, and what is drawn is the filled area inside the
						arcs. <br> Through a separate site, I attempted to recreate a very basic version
						of how the two approaches could appear when drawn. This was done so that throughout
						this trialling period, nothing in my code would be impacted. Roughly recreating
						the idea of approach one proved to be very simple, as it would just be dependent on
						the size and position of the second circle which is easily adjusted. While there
						may be easier ways to attempt the second approach, I shortly noticed which approach
						appears to easier and more functional. This is because, if the size or position
						was altered in the second arc, then the connection points would need to change
						and while achievable, I believe that the first approach would be the most suitable.
						The first approach will be better future proofed as this technique should be
						fairly malleable. </p>

							shown in the first video, it is clear that when the user draws a triangle
						at a reasonable speed, then it is drawn as intended, whereas if it is drawn
						at a fast speed, then the triangle would not be either an isosceles or right-angle.
						This is because, as seen in the video, the third point of the triangle was set
						to where the mouse finished. Due to this, when the mouse had released, from
						there being a small period of time where the mouse is still travelling, as the
						calculation of the y position for the final point is this.y3 = this.yMouseStart+this.h
						and height is calculated off of this.yMouse - this.yMouseStart so the calculation

						is just an even circle, that the crescent is just drawn in the first
						corner of where the guide is. To make it clearer to the user and so they
						can easily understand where their shape is being drawn, I intend to
						use a similar design to my square and circle options as I believe this
						method is both clear to the user, and their mouse while dragging to
						draw the shape remains connected to a draggable guide. The second
						issue with the positioning is that due to how the shape is drawn from
						left to right, I will need to ensure that how the crescent is drawn
						is reversed when drawn from left to right to fix this error. <br> As
						shown in the second video, in an attempt to successfully complete
						this component, it is now very close to my intended design. The
						moon shape now draws from the centre of the guide which was done
						through setting the starting position to be determined by the centre
						(this.xC and this,yC) and the width/height depending on how it is
						being drawn. The only issue that is present in this component is
						that the position of the circle when drawn from right to left is basing
						the second circle's position that is being cut instead of the centre
						postion of the main circle which is the crescents centre. <br> As seen
						in the final video for this component, I was able to fix this error
						through reversing the drawing process that occurs normally to
						create an inverse crescent. With this fixed, the crescent button is
						now performing how I had intended.</p>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>To review this sprint, there were two possible approaches that I could have
				pursued in this sprint, and I feel confident in the approach that I decided
				to take. Overall, I am satisfied with the final result of this sprint,
				despite a few errors and many design possibilities. Upon finding and individual's
				functions, it was very helpful and allowed me to consider more towards the design
				of the shape, which is something that is still very important, especially with a
				program that has active interactions with users. All the errors that I faced
				while completing this sprint was due the positioning of the moon shape within
				the rectangular area that the user draws with. They were relatively small errors
				and were pretty manageable to improve. Another this that can be reviewed for within
				this sprint is that I believe the approach that I decided upon is the best for the
				future proofing and sustainability relevant implication as there are many ways
				that a crescent can be made with and, using a circle-circle intercept function
				could be useful in the future to create a further range of shapes. Finally,
				while this was not an intended component of this sprint, I also fixed an error
				that occurred with how triangles are drawn in my program.</p>

				<h2 id="S9">Sprint 9</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint 9 is to create a moving ball function that will
				allow a user to create a ball travelling up and down. The user should be able to resize
				and control the area that the ball bounces in.</p>

				<h3>Different approaches for this sprint</h3>
				<img src="assets/img/sprint9diagram.jpg" style="max-width: 40%;" alt="Different possibilities for ball design">
				<p>As shown in the image above, there are two possible ways that I could go about
				this sprint and sizing the ball. There are many options that a ball could become 'moving',
				whereas my main aim for this sprint is to just create a ball that moves up and down,
				that the user can change the size of. For the first approach, the moving ball would
				only be sized by the width. This means that while the height is greater than the width,
				the ball would bounce reasonably as expected within the box. While this is not an error,
				it could be slightly off-putting for the user when the width is greater than the height,
				as to allow for them to size large moving balls, there is not much of an alternative.
				When the width is greater than the height, the centre point of the ball would bounce
				from line to line, so while it is not within the box entirely, it is still following
				the boundaries of the box to an extent. The second approach contradicts what has
				been my intention, as it would require up, down, left and right movements. It is
				uncertain how much this may change the understandability this approach
				would be for the user, and while the ball would remain within the box guidelines, this
				approach may also be confusing to a user. <br>If in future sprints where myself or
				an external programmer wishes to extend my program, I believe that through
				creating an individual up down motion button for a ball, the first approach is
				easily built upon. On top of this, the user will have a slightly more restricted
				ability to resize and have to deal with a singular button that causes a ball to
				travel both directions could be overwhelming. On top of this, the function for the
				second approach would be a lot more complicated, and as I am following the agile
				process, it is best to first construct a standard function that can be progressed in
				further sprints.</p>

						<p>In this first component test, as seen in the image to the left, I am testing
						my MovingBall class. The design of this class is slightly different to
						the other shapes that I have included in this program, because I needed
						to consider the animation aspect. My aim for this first component is to have
						the ball start from the position of the mouse, because then future components
						can develop on this idea. In the first video, the x start point was a fixed height from the
						point where the user clicks their mouse and the ball starts at the bottom of that height,
						travelling to where the mouse is clicked. This issue occurred because
						the y_b value is not the y starting position, it is actually the position
						that the ball travels to. As I had set the y_b position to this.yMouseStart
						instead of this.yMouse where the mouse button was released, the ball was travelling
						to the start position. In the second video, by changing the y_b to the end position
						of the mouse, it had worked as planned.

						<p>For the second component, I am testing how the MovingBall class functions
						as an object that a user can manipulate. The way that I am allowing the
						user to change the size of the ball that is bouncing is through the width which
						is occurring as intended. I also set the height that the ball will travel is
						equal to the height of the box that their mouse travels, which has also been
						successful. It appears that the issue with this component is that the position
						that the ball starts has two incorrect positions when the start position is to the right
						of the end position when drawing from right to  left. When drawing from right to left,
						if the height is greater than the width, then the position that the ball starts will be
						a radius away from the centre position. However, when the width is greater than the
						height, the circle will be a diameter away from the centre position. <br> To fix this
						issue, when the user is drawing an object from left to right, then the
						position the circle starts as is this.xMouse-(Math.abs(this.w)/2), whereas
						when it is the opposite, that total half width is adding to the this.xMouse.</p>

						<p>As seen in the first video, another thing that I had to consider was the
						speed that the ball was travelling. As I thought it would be a more fun
						alternative to setting a constant speed, I decided to randomise the speed.
						While randomising the speed creates a good variety of possibilities for the
						user. The only issue with this, as shown in the first video, is that while
						there is a low probability of this occurring, a ball could randomly start to
						travel exceptionally fast or slow. This could confuse, overwhelm or bore the user,
						which is why I needed to add in an upper and lower bounds into the random() calculation.
						<br> As seen in the second video, the balls are travelling at reasonable speeds with some but not
						extreme variation. I used Math.floor(Math.random() * (250 - 50 + 1) + 50), which
						set the max speed to be 250 tics and the minimum speed to be 50.</p>

						<p>With my bouncing ball, the centre point is where the mouse is released so to have the ball bouncing
						in the middle of the rectangle I subtracted half the diameter of the circle from the x starting point
						so the ball would always start in the middle. By adjusting the
						start position it is fairly simple to have the ball bounce on the inside line of
						the box space, and as seen in the first video, when the height is greater than
						the width this works ideally how it should. However, when the width was greater than the height
						then the ball would be drawn outside the rectangle. This was fixed by subtracting the width
						from the height of the rectangle and choosing the smaller of the two values meant that the
						ball was always within the rectangle.
						While it does not technically work how it should in that video, as the width would be greater,
						then the ball would not be able to move until the height is greater and there is no way that
						his could really be changed unless the size was not entirely decided by the width.
						<br>Because of this, I have chosen to continue with the alternative approach I have been
						taking throughout the addition of this class. While the ball does surpass the edges
						of the box, it does it in an understandable and clean sense.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In summary, I am also satisfied with the way that this sprint has progressed, as while
				there were a few technical errors which occurred, these were resolved in the most
				ideal way that they could, and remains clear to the user. There were a few times throughout
				this sprint where there were multiple approaches that I could take in terms of the design
				and usability. The first decision that I made was that the size of the ball would
				be determined by the width of the area that the user draws. As discussed above, I believe
				that this was the best approach to take for my program. Throughout the sprint there
				were a few errors that occurred in terms of the positioning of the ball, the speed and
				the sizing. I believe that all issues were effectively resolved through agile processes.
				The first issue I encountered was how I designed my MovingBall class, where and
				where the ball would first start and bounce to and was resolved swiftly. Issues to
				do with different ways of dragging the mouse were also resolved and I had to consider
				the possibly speeds that the balls could travel at. Lastly, I had another two approaches
				that I considered, although it proved that there was only truly approvable approach as the
				other one was not functional enough with the first approach that I chose.</p>

				<h2 id="S10">Sprint 10</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint 10 is to implement a star option for the user. Within

						<p>For component one of this sprint, when I was working on the calculations I quickly
						realised that there was a fair amount of complexity. As I needed to have an inner and outer
						circle and then calculate the angles between the lines depending on the number of points
						on the star. Thankfully when I was searching online I found a few examples on Stack Overflow
						and this example was the easist function to implement into my existing code so exactly like

						<p>For the second component, once I had sorted out the ratios that I wanted

						similar to my circle and crescent shapes, a star was drawn from the centre. As
						demonstrated in this first video, for my first attempt to test how it would
						be drawn, it is clear that I cannot make the x and y points based off of where
						the mouse starts (this.xMouseStart and this.yMouseStart), as a star is drawn
						with cos and sin curves, so the start position is the centre (this.xC and
						this.yC). The second error with my first attempt was that the radius cannot
						only be based off of the width, and must be dependent on the smaller value of
						either the width or height, which follows a similar principle to what I have
						been following with previous shapes. <br> As shown in the second video for this
						component, through the aid of an external star function, the implementation
						of the main purpose of this sprint was fairly clean. Through fixing these
						two errors using methods I have similarly used in previous sprints, my
						star button was functional and clear for the user. As well as this, because

						<p>As seen in the first video in this test, I noticed that when you click
						while an object is selected, then that click would be added into the object array.
						This was clear because if you had clicked, then that click would also need to be removed
						or re-added to the array. An example of this is shown in the video to the left,
						where when the user clicks, an empty object is drawn each time the user clicks the
						screen while a shape option is selected. When I first noticed this, I assumed that
						it was not an error, and that it was just a small object being drawn. To test if
						this was true, I printed out the width and height of an object that is being drawn,
						as shown in the image in the middle. From this test, it is clear that when the
						user clicked on the screen, then an object with zero dimensions would be drawn
						(the zero values for width and height were given when I clicked the screen).
						As something with a width and/or height of zero should not be considered as an object,
						this is an error that needs to be fixed. This was a simple fix, as I created
						a loop before an object is drawn with the conditions that the width, height,
						radiusX and radiusY cannot equal zero. As demonstrated in the last video test,

						<p>This is a styling improvement instead of an issue, but it is a relatively

						the shift options for the rectangle and ellipse, was that it was not fully
						clear to the user what it meant by this. Especially if younger children
						or beginner designers may use this program in the future, they may not
						be familiar with a shift button option. My approach to improve the communication
						to the user was through changing the text of the rectangle and ellipse to
						square and circle when the user presses the shift button. As shown in the first
						video, I first tested if this would work through altering the text of all
						interactive buttons when the shift key is pressed. As this component was
						successful, I was able to move onto the second component which is just
						focusing on the two individual buttons. The way that I individually altered
						the text of the rectangle and ellipse button was through adding a new variable
						within the InteractiveButton class, called 'altText'. Through this, I was
						able to alter the text that is presented to the user on the button if the
						button has an altText and the shift button is down. By designing the alternative
						text like this, I am complying the sustainability and future proofing
						relevant implication because in the future of my program there may be many
						cases where I will want a button to be able to have a different text

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In this sprint, the implementation of the star function was successfully and mainly
				occurred as intended. I am satisfied with the outcome of my program and the way this
				sprint has progressed. Through a star function that I have found from Stack Overflow,
					I was able to adapt this function into my code for a star button. It was very useful
					to find a function that could be applied to a program such as mine, as the process
					of calculating the output would have been quite difficult. There were a few very minor
					errors that I have encountered throughout the process of building this code, and so
					this sprint remained quite clean as these problems were easily resolved. While these
					were not originally intended to be included within this sprint, I noticed one
					error that needed addressing and resolving along with one design element that I could
					improve on. Both of these additional focuses within this sprint also were successful and
					there were no major unexpected errors that occurred. I believe that this will be my
				last sprint of this project because I am satisfied with how my project is at and fulfills
				my intended aim. There is still room where I could expand further in this project, as
				shown on my project backlog, but the state that my project is at, is an acceptable
				standard. </p>

				<p>To test the functionality of my program, I decided to run it through Safari to

				entirely identically. There is only one noticeable difference between the two
				browsers, and that is that instead of the objects drawing from the point of the
				mouse, in Safari my objects and guides are drawn based off of the centre of the

				like the functionality test, is an important process to do because the program
				designer can miss what an unpredictable user may do. I believe that she quickly
				got the hang of the program, and I had positive feedback once the test had been
				completed. While watching what she was doing, if this project was to extend
				further any further, I could look into creating the undo, redo and clear button

				<h2 id="R">Reflection</h2>
				<p>Throughout the course of this project, to ensure that it ran effectively and
					that I produced a high-quality digital technologies' outcome, I used the Agile
					project management method. To manage and store my project, I have used GitHub
					as a tool to aid in my keeping to the Agile structure. I have been able to
					update and expand on my project backlog and individual kanban boards per sprint.
					In the initial stages of beginning my project, in alignment with the Agile
					process, the first step that I completed was creating a project backlog. As
					it has been discussed earlier on this planning document, my project backlog
					was a crucial first step because it contained all of my compiled sprints
					that I was intending to complete and abide by throughout the course of my
					project. If I had not completed this first step in the Agile process,
					then I would not have had a guide to follow as my project developed, which
					could have meant that I would not have met my goals and intentions by
					travelling off course from my endgame. As well as this, through a project
					backlog I was able to plan a sprint order by priority. If I had not done this,
					then it could have been tempting to focus on unnecessary parts of my project
					and lost valuable time that could have been towards the most crucial aspects.
					From this, each individual sprint also had a kanban board which meant that
					I could track and follow each component in a sensible manner. Within each
					sprint I also used planning components in set orders such as pseudocode,
					general design work such as sketches and natural-language explanations.
					Through doing this, it ensured that I could have a clear understanding of
					each part in my development process and future programmers can also be
					able to gain a comprehensive understanding of my development process.
					Within each sprint, I thoroughly tested each new addition to my program
					and then reflected upon these new elements to insightfully determine
					the next stage in my development process whilst abiding to my original
					plan. After each completed sprint, I committed the changes that I had made
					to GitHub, where it can store and even recover historic versions of
					my programming process in a case where this is needed. There were many
					things that I learnt throughout following the Agile process, some of
					which include the importance of extensive testing and planning. There
					were many times when I was very fortunate to have exact layouts of
					what I am required to complete and how to stay on track. This process
					has most definitely enhanced the overall product of my program because
					decomposing each component, then trialling, and then reflecting, allowed
					me to notice even the smallest of errors and has taught me how to
					thoroughly consider different outcomes and possibilities. I believe that
					the main aim of my program has been achieved through following this
					Agile process, as I believe and have tested, a child of various ages
					should be able to enjoy and learn from this program.

<h2 id="RI">Relevant Implications Summary</h2>
				<h3><u>Sustainability and future proofing</u></h3>
				<p>Throughout my program, I have addressed the relevant implication of sustainability and
				future proofing. This relevant implication is important to consider, as a program
				should be adaptable and have the ability to expand with new features.
				Throughout the process of designing this program, I actively kept this relevant implication
				in mind. In the case of a drawing program, working through a button-by-button process
				for the majority of the time, makes for a program to be easily expanded on. This means
				that if future developers wish to build new features into the program,
				each class and/or function is separate and unique to the intended task. Due to this,
				it has been very easy to implement new components in my code, because each individual
				button predominantly had its own unique code path so did not impact other function.
				Beyond this, when designing each new class and/or function, I ensured that I was designing
				it with the intention or ability to be expanded on. As for just one small example of this
				within my code, by creating a colour array with a loop to print out each colour string, it is
				very easy to alter or increase/decrease the colours available. So when I later did include
				more colour options, this process was very easy. My code has been extensively commented in a clear
				and understandable way, so anyone else who wants to expand on my project can easily do so. On top
				of this, all of my variable, function and class names are appropriate and easy to interpret, and
				each filed document is also clear with the names and placements of items. As well as this, due to
				my thorough documentation following the Agile process and each sprint being easily accessible on GitHub,
				future programmers can clearly follow my design process. </p>
				<h3><u>Usability</u></h3>
				<p>The relevant implication, usability, is also very important to focus on while
				building a program. It focuses on the idea that a digital product is able to be
				understood and properly used for it's desired purpose. That errors can be recognised
				and recovered from throughout the process, that all information is displayed in
				a clear way, so the proper requirements of the program is executed in the most efficient way.
				For a program that is solely based on user input, it is crucial to have a good usability
				to ensure that the process through using this drawing program was effective, intuitive, and able to
				be understood. Just one example of this in my program, is the placement and colouring of my undo,
				redo and clear buttons. In the first case, having a red clear button in the right
				corner of the screen acts as a warning in two senses. The first is because an exit button
				or a clear, or cancel button is normally placed in the top right-hand corner of the screen.
				This means that a typical user will subconsciously be familiar with this idea, meaning that
				it is less likely a user will accidentally select this button. The second is the colour red
				which is also a clear warning with an association to things such as a stop sign. This was
				also discussed earlier when I was designing these buttons. Another example of this
				is the hover over change in colour, especially with the design of my buttons, as the
				secondary buttons cannot be interacted with until its parent button has been selected.
				This means that the user has an indication of what buttons they can interact with,
				before selecting anything. On top of this, the draggable guides give users an indication
				of what their drawing action will do upon release. The buttons in my program are
				also designed like conventional buttons, so this should not confuse the user with
				their purposes. On top of this, I ensured that I did a few personal usability tests,
				and one video test with a user that was not familiar with my program, to gain
				a further insight on how the usability of my program could be improved.
				These are just some of the many examples where I actively considered the
				usability throughout the design process.</p>
				<h3><u>Functionality</u></h3>
				<p>The final relevant implication that I have addressed is functionality. Functionality
				is about having a digital product that operates correctly, without any errors or
				crashes. This is also a very important relevant implication to consider while
				building a program, as if there are many errors throughout a program,
				then the desired outcome cannot be reached. A functional program should perform
				with the expectation of errors and unexpected inputs/outcomes, and have the
				ability to either prevent or recover from these occurring. Especially when
				focusing around the input of a user, as mine does, because users cannot be relied
				upon to not use the program in unexpected ways that could generate an error.
				If a system crashes or does not run with ease, then it's functionality is poor.
				To ensure the functionality of my program, I have been actively testing my program while following
				the Agile process. This has been a vital step throughout the development of
				my code. I can guarantee that without testing and following the Agile process, the functionality
				of my code would not be at an acceptable standard. Upon the spotting of each error,
				I either immediately fixed it, or kept a very close eye on the status of the error
				while focusing on other elements to shortly return to, and improve it. At the stage of
				my code, there are no instances where my program crashes, and no errors that would
				impact the functionality of my code. To test the functionality of my code, I ran it
				through a Javascript code checker to ensure that there are no unwanted errors, and I
				tested my program in a Safari browser. Both of these tests did not show any
				concerning signs for the functionality of my program.</p>
