				<h1>Brief</h1>
				<p>For this project, I aim to create a drawing application that allows users to draw shapes, lines and
					manage colours. The overall purpose of this application is to help educate young children on the
					basics of geometry through various shapes, and encourage creativity in a childâ€™s mind; giving them
					the freedom to endlessly explore principles of composition and style. This should hopefully include
					the simple features of a drawing application like shape, size and colour tools, which may lead to a
					more advanced canvas where older children can continue to learn from new methods and ways of
					thinking about creativity. Through the development of creativity at a young age, this will help to
					advance mental growth in things such as problem-solving and new possibilities, while also helping
					to gain an understanding of how a child thinks or feels.

					<br>I intend to follow the agile process throughout the production of this project, as I believe
					this method is best suited to achieve my ideal outcome successfully. I will also be using GitHub,
					which is a website that can manage and store my entire project accordingly, including the project
					backlog and projects for each sprint (which are important aspects of the agile process). GitHub can
					also record and track each stage of working throughout the build, allowing access to previous
					versions of my final project in case unpredicted situations were to occur.

    <h2 id="S1">Sprint One</h2>
<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint one is to create a basic canvas with a grid, that follows the movement and
acknowledges the boundaries of the mouse. On top of this, I aim to include a traceable guide that once released by
the mouse, a permanent box is drawn.</p>

<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the boundaries on the mouse through console logging the class
'InteractiveObject', which I have designed to tract the status of the mouse. It is shown in the video, that the
mouse's movements (click, down and up) will only be recorded if the mouse is inside the canvas, this is because in
the future of this project, the user should not be needing to draw or control elements outside canvas as that is the
primary use for a canvas. It can also be seen that my grid class is successfully working in the background
of the canvas and the canvas itself has been created without fault. So far, in these early stages I have been
presented with no unexpected errors.</p>

<p>In this video test, I am testing the functionality of the draggable guide and the drawing of rectangles. As
shown in the beginning of the video, as long as the mouse stays within the canvas. The draggable guide correctly
follows the dragging of a users mouse to indicate to them where the box will be drawn and when released,
the box also correctly follows the position of the draggable guide when released. While these aspects of my
code do work accordingly, there are also some errors that occur. <br> Due to the fact that the mouse's actions are not
recorded while outside the canvas, if the user was to press and hold the mouse inside the canvas, to then
move the mouse outside the canvas without the mouse being released, a box cannot be drawn. So when the
mouse returns to the canvas up, the guide still follows the mouse but no box is drawn. A similar thing occurs
when the mouse has gone outside the canvas, to return down. Because the origin point where the mouse clicked
down was not recorded, upon releasing the mouse inside the canvas, the box is drawn in an incorrect place and
there is an absence of the draggable guide. Finally, due to the method I used to create the draggable guide,
the sizing of the inner circle sometimes ends up not sizing correctly in relation to the outer box, which
results in the circle to surpass the edges of the box.</p>

 <h2>Sprint Review</h2>
<p>In summary, this sprint has been fairly successful in terms of setting up the project for a large range of
possibilities. I can track the relevant movements and position of the users mouse which is important for many
aspects like drawing and selecting shapes and options. As of this sprint, the user can draw a coloured box
with the assistance of the draggable guide inside the gridded canvas. While there were a few errors that I
noticed to do with the user entering and exiting the mouse as well as with the draggable guide (which I
discussed in detail in the testing), I intend to fix these errors in future sprints so the program is
error-proof, which is something very important when dealing with the unexpected nature of children.</p>

				<h2 id="S2">Sprint Two</h2>
				<p><b>Aim:</b> My aim for sprint two is to create two buttons that will allow the user to draw
				either an ellipse shape with their mouse or a rectangle shape. I aim to have a working class
				and function that will correctly draw and show a draggable guide for the ellipse, as well as
				create a button class to manage these two possible options for drawing.</p>

						<p>In this video testing to the left, I am testing the functionality of sprint 2 and how
						both my ellipse, guide and buttons work. As it can be seen, moving from drawing
						rectangles to ellipses is manageable and works as intended for the user. It is a clear
						for the user what the purpose of each button is and now the user has slightly
						more variation in my drawing program. I had a small problem with the guide earlier on
						in the sprint (as seen in the image below), where the circle was not drawing in the
						correct position. Fortunately, this was only a very small mistake, as I quickly realised
						that I had forgotten to divide my x+w and y+h values by two, so the circle guide would
						correctly draw where the mouse was clicked. Aside from this, this sprint ran fairly
						smoothly as I was able to add the ellipse class and function, to be ran dependant on
						the status of the InteractiveButton class, which I created for the purpose of selectable
						buttons. I have also included a few lines of code that I have used for the boundaries
						for the button class. This was important to get right so the buttons work as desired. At
						the end of the video it is shown how the same issue with the rectangles and the user
						leaving the canvas also occurs when the user draws an ellipse. While I clearly have not
						fixed this error in this sprint, I still aim to improve this in future sprints so my
						program is error free and able to be used by a user seamlessly. </p>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<p>In the end, this sprint was completed as expected and there were no major errors that I faced
				while building it. I successfully created an ellipse function and class so the user can draw
				ellipses at this current stage. Pairing with this, the draggable guide for the ellipse also
				is working without any remaining errors. I am satisfied with how the InteractiveButton class
				functions as the boundaries and task that each button is set to do, is completed in the
				intended way. I think this base class should work well for the future of this project,
				especially as most sprints aims are to include a new feature to the drawing project, each
				that should have a different button to be able to use it. All the current issues are ones
				that I addressed in sprint 1, as the same thing occurs when drawing ellipses if the user
				enters and exits the canvas, which should be something I will fix in a future sprint.</p>
